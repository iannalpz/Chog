	<p><br>A simple greeting in a different way for you! I wish you all the best in the world my dear. Blessed is the day you were born and all the day that follows you're in it. I'm sure a lot of people are grateful to have you in their lives right now. I know, cause I am one of them. Wag ka na masyadong malungkot, magwowork out din lahat eventually. Dreams, money, career or kung ano man yan just keep on working on it right? <br></p>
	<p><em>Wishing you love, sunshine and laughter not just for today but all the days after!</em></p>
